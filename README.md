To access the live Crypto Dashboard, use this link: [Crypto Dashboard](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMTRmMDE0MmMtNGVkNi00ZWQ2LTljY2EtNjViMmVmZTBmMjMzIiwidCI6IjA0NjZlNDc4LWQ5MjMtNDliOS1hZGYzLWRiYzI0MTVkOGEwZiJ9).

This version of the report refreshes every hour due to limitations with the "Publish to Web" feature in Power BI. You can read more about these limitations [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-publish-to-web#considerations-and-limitations).

I do have another version of the report which is connected via direct lake and that report updates with a 1 minute latency.
